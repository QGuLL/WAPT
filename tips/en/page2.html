          A private (.pem) - public (.crt) keypair will be generated 
          to allow for package authentication.<br>
          Only packages signed with your private key may be installed onto 
          agents.<br>
          The <b>private key (.pem)</b> must not be disclosed to a third party 
          under any circumstances.<br>
          The <b>public certificate (.crt)</b> may however be disclosed. It will 
          be deployed onto client hosts via the custom installer.<br>
          <br>
          <i>NB. : the private key must be generated only once per organisation.</i>
