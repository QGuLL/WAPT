          <b>Tranquil IT Systems</b> provides an array of WAPT packages 
          at <a href="http://wapt.tranquil.it">wapt.tranquil.it</a> <br>
          For a quick start with your new WAPT installation, download ready-made
          packages and deploy them onto your network .<br>
          
          When you pull or create a package, its name will be prefixed 
          with
          your trigram/quadrigram to mark its 
          provenance.<br>
          Replace "test" with a trigram meaningful to your organisation (ex: tis 
          standing for
          Tranquil IT Systems).<br>
          
          The development directory is where 
          information
          about your package in development will be stored. <br>
