          <b>WAPT</b> clients make requests to the server.<br>
          In order to connect to the WAPT server,
          it is advisable that a DNS name be used, as long as it has been correctly
          configured in your network''s DNS environment.<br>
          We suggest naming your WAPT server 'srvwapt.mydomain.local'
          (A record type), then binding an alias (CNAME record type, e.g.
          'wapt.mydomain.local') to srvwapt.<br>
          In case you don't trust your DNS, or you are just setting up a
          testing environment, you can fall back to the server IP address.
